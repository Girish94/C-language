A literal is a value itself.
A string literal is collection of characters. Ex : "HELLO".

A regular string literal consists of zero or more characters enclosed in double quotes,
as in " hello ",and may include both simple escape sequences (such as \t for the tab character)
and hexadecimal and Unicode escape sequences.
